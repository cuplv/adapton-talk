Two parts to the expression tree example:
1. tree evaluation (showing switching swapping and sharing) and
2. tree mapping (showing the benefit of using names).

**Jeff's Story:**
1. Here are expression trees (constants only)
2. Switching, swapping, sharing
3. Here's how Adapton works
4. It's great
5. But now suppose we add variables
6. We might want to do map
7. And a funny thing happens
